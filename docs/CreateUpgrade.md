# Creating or upgrading the TiddlyServer

Creating the initial TiddlyServer is very much the same as upgrading the
TiddlyServer to a new version of TiddlyWiki.

The basic idea is to get a new `empty.html` file from the TiddlyWiki
website, add the plugins you want to use, and then save your `empty.html`
file into the TiddlyServer's webspace.


## NOTE

The current implementation of the ReEnable Official Plugins does NOT work.
