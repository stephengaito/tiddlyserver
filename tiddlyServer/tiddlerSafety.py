Just to add that the .tid file format really is as simple as it looks,
with the constraints implied by that simplicity:

* Field names cannot contain colons
* Field values (apart from the "text" field) cannot contain newlines

The core works around these limitations by saving tiddlers in JSON format
if they don't meet the criteria for .tid files.

Best wishes

Jeremy

WE ARE BEING TOO STRICT; Further more, since we are explicitly assuming a
TiddlyWiki V5.2 or greater, all tiddlers are stored in JSON in the browser.
This means that all we care about is that WE can store and reload tiddlers.
